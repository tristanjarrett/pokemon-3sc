# PokeAPI React Client

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6716dc2f-ebf0-4495-82ec-17c7bd20b849/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/superb-muffin-41e605/deploys)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run Locally

To run the app on your local computer you will need to have Node.js installed, this will include npm which will be used to run the project. Clone or download a zip of the source files and then use the following commands to get started:

```sh
cd /your-path-here/pokemon-3sc
```

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```

## Features

- View and filter through all Pokemon on the main page
- Deep dive to an overview of specific Pokemon details
- Ability to add and remove Pokemon from a favourites list
- TODO: Filter Pokemon by Generation
- TODO: Compare Pokemon

## Libraries/Frameworks

- Node Sass - used to compile SCSS files on the fly
- React Bootstrap - speed up the UI build process
- React Icons - useful icons done simply
- React Router Dom - used to navigate through different pages or "routes"

## Challenges

- Its been a while since createing a similar app from scratch so needed to brush up on some knowledge (thanks google!)
- Wanted to adhere to the PokeAPI fair use policy so needed to find a simple and quick way to cache data (my solution is not the most practical for dynamic content but fine for this example)

## Additional functionality

- Cache API data in local storage
- TODO: Pagination on Pokemon list (as there is over 1000 results on the request) 

## If I had more time I would

- Go outside :deciduous_tree:
- Have a coffee :coffee:
- Try forget about Pokemon, lol
